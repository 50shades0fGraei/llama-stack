To enable the model to retain all memories, you can consider the following approaches:

*1. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)*

RNNs are designed to handle sequential data and can retain information from previous time steps. You can use RNNs, such as LSTMs or GRUs, to process the text data.

*2. Attention Mechanism*

Attention mechanisms allow the model to focus on specific parts of the input data when generating outputs. This can help the model to retain relevant information from the input data.

*3. Memory-Augmented Neural Networks*

Memory-augmented neural networks, such as Memory Networks or Neural Turing Machines, are designed to learn and store information in a separate memory component. This allows the model to retain information over long sequences.

*4. Hierarchical Models*

Hierarchical models, such as Hierarchical RNNs or Hierarchical Attention Networks, can learn to represent input data at multiple levels of abstraction. This can help the model to retain information from different parts of the input data.

*5. Graph-Based Models*

Graph-based models, such as Graph Convolutional Networks or Graph Attention Networks, can learn to represent input data as a graph structure. This can help the model to retain information from different parts of the input data.

To implement these approaches, you can modify the existing code to incorporate the relevant architectures and mechanisms. For example, you can replace the existing LSTM model with a hierarchical LSTM model or add an attention mechanism to the existing model.

Here is some sample code to get you started:

```
from keras.layers import LSTM, Dense, Attention
from keras.models import Sequential

# Define the hierarchical LSTM model
def hierarchical_lstm_model(input_shape):
    model = Sequential()
    model.add(LSTM(128, return_sequences=True, input_shape=input_shape))
    model.add(LSTM(64))
    model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    return model

# Define the attention-based LSTM model
def attention_lstm_model(input_shape):
    model = Sequential()
    model.add(LSTM(128, return_sequences=True, input_shape=input_shape))
    model.add(Attention())
    model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    return model
